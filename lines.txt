You find yourself in a dense forest. Despite your fuzzy memory you look start to look at your surroundings and notice a waterfall off in the distance.
A majestic waterfall cascades down rugged cliffs, its crystal-clear waters alive with vibrant aquatic dance as schools of colorful fish navigate the sparkling currents, creating a mesmerizing tableau of life and motion. You see something rippling the water from behind the waterfall  You could (1) investigate that or (2) attempt to grab a fish out of the water.
As you sprint towards the waterfall with unbridled enthusiasm, an unexpected collision with the hidden rocks behind sends a jarring shock through your body, abruptly halting the thrill and leaving you gasping for air on the ground. As the light fades from your eyes you see an eagle soaring overhead and you are inspired knowing that Uncle Sam always has your back. you die a peacful death.
With a swift and triumphant motion, you snatch a gleaming fish from the pond, raising it above your head in jubilation; however, before you can revel in your victory, a majestic eagle swoops down, talons outstretched, attempting to snatch the prize from your grasp. Undeterred, you cling tenaciously to the squirming fish as the eagle, undeterred, sweeps you off your feet and into an unexpected airborne adventure.
Perched high in the eagle's nest, surrounded by a panoramic vista of treetops and distant landscapes, a sense of awe and vulnerability washes over, as you find yourself an unexpected guest in this lofty aerie. You decide there are only two ways out of this, you can (1) attempt to talk your way out with the eagle or (2) you can attempt to fight the eagle.
Amidst the soaring heights, a titanic clash ensues between you and the majestic eagle, a dance of precision and agility. With strategic finesse, you anticipate the eagle's every move, dodging its razor-sharp talons and countering with calculated strikes. In a final, decisive moment, you seize the opportunity, landing a powerful blow that leaves the once-mighty bird incapacitated, securing your victory in this exhilarating aerial duel. A sudden realization washes over you as you gaze upon the innocent baby chicks nestled in the now subdued nest, and a pang of guilt tugs at your heart. Overwhelmed by a newfound sense of responsibility, you make a solemn vow to dedicate the rest of your days to nurturing and caring for the orphaned chicks, your commitment turning a once-battlefield into a sanctuary of compassion and protection.
In a moment of self-deprecation, you feel a bit foolish for attempting to converse with an eagle. However, to your astonishment, the majestic bird responds, not in screeches or squawks, but with eloquent words delivered in a refined British accent. "I apologize stranger, i just wanted that fish to feed my hungry children." Your options are to (1) offer the eagle the fish or (2) move the fish behind your back.
"Oh I didn't know you had babies, here you go." You hand the eagle the fish. The bird takes it and says: "why, thank you so much! If more people were like you we would have a better society indeed." The eagle carries you to safety and you live happily ever after.
In a moment of hesitation, you choose to hide the fish behind your back, causing the once eloquent eagle to express disappointment and frustration in its refined British accent, as the opportunity for a mutual understanding slips away. The air becomes charged with tension, marking a missed chance for compassion amid the unexpected exchange. You can (1) try to defuse the situation by offering to go catch another fish or (2) hold firm, you're not going to let some bird take your hard earned fish.
"Too little too late, I want that fish," the bird says while gesturing towards your hand. he lunges at your hand and knocks it free. You wrestle the beast to the nest and hold it there. You feel a wave of accomplishment, having just succesfully wrestled an eagle but this feeling blinds you to the razor sharp talon coming towards your head from the left. Suddenly all is still. Your body freezes and you see a light shining down from the heavens. In the light a figure starts to take shape. It is none other than Zeus, King of the Gods, "Hello my son, This is a death befitting a champion but it is not your time. Some day we will laugh about this in Olympus. Until then, good luck my friend." The light fades and time starts to move again but there is no eagle under you. Simply an ashy circle where the eagle used to be. Reduced to dust right in front of your eyes. In udder disbelief you climb down from the tree and notice a small town in the distance. You start to walk over feeling a new sense of purpose in your life. You have been given a gift from the heavens, you will not squander it.
The bird sighs and says, "Fine, you can keep your dumb fish, my babies and I will just starve." You feel a tinge of guilt, will you (1) leave with your fish or (2) reluctantly hand over your fish?
You start to climb down from the tree but you don't get very far before you slip and lose your grip. As you fall through the air you are sure these are your last moments alive. You have deprived starving chicks of food and you know this is what you deserve. You close your eyes and brace for impact. Then it all goes black.
You hand over the fish and the bird thanks you. You leave unscathed and find a nearby civilization. You could just leave and let it all go but you loved that fish. You know in your heart of hearts that you must retrieve your fallen ally. RETURN IN PART II TO SEE THE THRILLING RESCUE OF UNNAMED FISH #1!!
